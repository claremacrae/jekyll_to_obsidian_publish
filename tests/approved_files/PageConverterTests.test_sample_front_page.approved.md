# Introduction

> [!Danger] About this site
> This is an experimental conversion of the Tasks user docs to Obsidian Publish, tracked in [#1706](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1706).
>
> This site - [publish.obsidian.md/tasks](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/queries/sorting) - is now well-tested, and you are welcome to stay here and use the site. The content is the same as on the original site.
>
> Every page here has a 'View this page on the old documentation site' section at the bottom, making it easy to compare the old and new sites side-by-side, and to report any problems you find.
>
> You can read more about progress on this conversion, including known problems and remaining steps, at the [[migration|Migration to Publish]] page.
>
> Alternatively, you can visit the [original documentation site](https://obsidian-tasks-group.github.io/obsidian-tasks/) instead.
